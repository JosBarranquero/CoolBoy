    <h2>Before starting...</h2>
    <p>CoolBoy needs to be run as Administrator, otherwise it won't be able to work.</p>
    <p>The <i>setup.bat</i> file can be run to create a firewall exception on port 80. Only run it if you know what you're doing.</p>

    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>In the Preferences window, you can select the folder where your HTML files are stored, as well as the default main file (which is <i>index.html</i> by default).</p>
    
    <h2>That's all folks</h2>
    <p>Don't expect too much from CoolBoy, though, as it is mostly a toy.</p>

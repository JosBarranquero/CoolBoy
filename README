# CoolBoy
This is a simple web server, written in C# as a testing tool.

## Requirements
This project uses the 4.8 version of the .NET Framework, although it should be able to be compiled with earlier version (as early as 2.0, [I pressume](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.httplistener?view=net-7.0)).
